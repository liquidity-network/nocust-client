Liquidity Network's underlying technology are NOCUST commit-chains, a layer 2 solution to scale blockchains such as Ethereum and it works today on the mainet!

A commit-chain is a _chain of commits_ ‚õìÔ∏è, that means that NOCUST is committing regularly, every _round_, a commit of the commit-chain to the parent Ethereum chain. The commit-chain is run by a **non-custodial hub**, or operator, and clients communicate with the hub.

Contrary to side-chains, commit-chains don't need an additional consensus mechanism and rely on the security of the parent chain \(here Ethereum\). We refer the interested developer to a basic introduction of [basic introduction of NOCUST](https://blog.liquidity.network/2018/11/21/nocust-101/), we provide extensive details in [NOCUST overview](nocust-overview.md), and for the formal geeks [we provide a paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/642.pdf) ü§ì .

For developers, we start by describing the JavaScript client library for NOCUST üì± \(how to make transactions\).
